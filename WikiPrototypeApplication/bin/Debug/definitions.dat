ArrayArrayLinear¢In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key.Binary Search TreeTree
Non-Linear•In computer science, a binary search tree, also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.GraphGraphs
Non-LinearÖIn math, a graph can be defined as a pictorial representation or a diagram that represents data or values in an organized manner. The points on the graph often represent the relationship between two or more things.
Hash TableHash
Non-Linear±In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary. It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.HeapTree
Non-LinearñIn computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.Linked ListListLinearˆA linked list is a data structure to store items in a linear way. It is composed of nodes that connect with the next and previous items.ListListLinear‚Represents a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index. Provides methods to search, sort, and manipulate lists.QueueAbstractLinearåIn computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.Self-Balancing TreeTree
Non-LinearýA Binary Search Tree (abbreviated as BST) is a special type of Binary Tree where the value of the data element at each node is greater than or equal to all node values in its left sub-tree and less than or equal to all node values in its right sub-tree.SetAbstract
Non-Linear¼In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set.StackAbstractLinearøIn computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.Two Dimension ArrayArrayLinear¥The two-dimensional array can be defined as an array of arrays. The 2D array is organized as matrices which can be represented as the collection of rows and columns.
